Terminals:
EOL = line break
WS = space or tab
IDENT = [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*
TEXT = any run of non-EOL characters (may include spaces)
DocComment      ::= "/**" EOL? DocBody "*/"

DocBody         ::= ( Paragraph | TagBlock | EmptyLine )*
Paragraph       ::= TextLine (EOL TextLine)* EOL?
TagBlock        ::= TagLine (EOL ContLine)*
EmptyLine       ::= EOL

TextLine        ::= TEXT                     // line NOT starting with '@'
TagLine         ::= "@" IDENT (WS IDENT)? (WS TEXT)?
ContLine        ::= TEXT                     // continuation: a line NOT starting with '@'


Semantics:
Paragraph: consecutive non-@ lines form free text. The first non-empty line of the first paragraph is your implicit @brief unless an explicit @brief tag appears.
TagBlock:
@param <name> <desc…> → param with name and description.
@return <desc…>
@brief <desc…>
@note <desc…>
@deprecated <desc…>

 - Any following normalized lines that do not start with @ are continuations of the current tag’s text (joined with spaces or newlines; your choice).
 - Empty normalized lines separate paragraphs but do not break a TagBlock (they’re appended to the current tag as a blank line if you keep paragraphing inside tags).
 - Scanner guardrails
 - Recognize a doc block only if you see "/**" not immediately followed by / (i.e., ignore the empty token /**/).
 - Stop at the first */.
 - Strings/char literals are skipped before comment detection, so "/**" inside quotes doesn’t trigger.
 - Tiny, deterministic rules for edge cases
 - Lines may have * or not; normalization makes them equivalent.
 - Tabs/spaces anywhere around * are fine.
 - Continuation is purely lexical: if a normalized line starts with @, it begins a new TagBlock; otherwise it’s a continuation of the current TagBlock (if any) or part of a Paragraph.


# Example

/**
* First line is the brief.
  Second line of the same paragraph.

* @param user  pointer to user data
  may continue here, even without '*'
*   and keep going if indented
* @return status code
*/


/**
 * @brief Opens the thing.
 * @param path  file path
   accepts continuation without '*'
 *
   A free-text paragraph after tags.
